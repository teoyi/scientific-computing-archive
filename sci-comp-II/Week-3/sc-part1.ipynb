    "We will use materials data for superconducting materials to create machine learning models to predict the superconducting transition temperature of superconducting materials. We will not try to predict the potential of a material to be a superconductor, as this is a question that far exceeds the scope of this class project.\n",

    "Your project should use as a guide the relevant sections of the paper \n",
    "**Machine learning modeling of superconducting critical temperature**\n",
